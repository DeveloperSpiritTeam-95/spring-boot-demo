# Project Description for spring-boot-demo:

This Spring Boot demo project demonstrates a <h4>low-level implementation of CRUD operations using MongoClient.</h4> It showcases custom code for connecting to a MongoDB database and performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on data collections. The project serves as an example of integrating MongoDB with a Spring Boot application without relying on higher-level abstractions like Spring Data MongoDB.
