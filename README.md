# Project Description for spring-boot-demo:

<h3> demo </h3>
<h4>low-level CRUD Operations with MongoClient</h4>
This Spring Boot demo project demonstrates a <h4>low-level implementation of CRUD operations using MongoClient.</h4> It showcases custom code for connecting to a MongoDB database and performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on data collections. The project serves as an example of integrating MongoDB with a Spring Boot application without relying on higher-level abstractions like Spring Data MongoDB.

<h3> demo1 </h3>
<h4>Mid-Level CRUD Operations with Spring Data MongoDB</h4>
This demo showcases a Spring Boot application structured in a layered architecture, utilizing Spring Data MongoDB for CRUD operations. The project illustrates a mid-level approach by organizing the code into distinct layers, enhancing maintainability and leveraging Spring Data's powerful abstractions for MongoDB interactions.

<h3>demo2</h3>
<h4>Advance-Level CRUD Operations with Spring Data MongoDB and code implementation</h4>
This demo showcases a Spring Boot application structured in a package layered architecture, utilizing Spring Data MongoDB for CRUD operations. The project is a advanced-level approach by organizing the code into distinct layers, enhancing maintainability and leveraging Spring Data's powerful abstractions for MongoDB interactions.
